# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
**Centralized repository for PalletCloud’s Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).**
This repository captures and maintains the project’s architectural and technical decisions in a structured, consistent way. By documenting the context, options considered, rationale, and consequences of each decision, it ensures transparency, traceability, and alignment across all PalletCloud teams. It also serves as a living knowledge base to guide future contributors, reduce decision drift, and provide historical context for why the system is designed the way it is.
