## üöÄ Getting Started

This repository serves as the central documentation hub for PalletCloud. Navigate through the documentation to understand:

### üìñ Documentation Journey
1. **[System Requirements](docs/system-requirements.md)** - Start here to understand what the platform accomplishes
2. **[High-Level Architecture](docs/high-level-architecture.md)** - Learn how the system is structured and organized
3. **[Cloud Routing](docs/cloud-routing.md)** - Understand the infrastructure setup and domain configuration
4. **[User Journey](docs/user-jouney-order-status.md)** - Follow how users interact with the platform
5. **[Service Flows](docs/service-side-user-creation-flow.md)** - Dive into backend processes and workflows

### üé® Visual Learning
- Explore the `/diagrams` directory for comprehensive visual representations
- Start with system architecture diagrams for high-level understanding
- Review process flows for detailed workflow comprehension
- Check ERD diagrams for database design insights

### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decisions
- Browse `/adrs` directory to understand key technical decisions
- Each ADR provides context, rationale, and consequences of architectural choices
- Follow the decision trail from database selection to framework choices

---

## üìã ADR Framework

Our architectural decisions are documented using the ADR (Architectural Decision Record) framework to ensure transparency, traceability, and alignment across teams.

### üìù ADR Process
- **Template**: Each ADR follows the standard template in `000-template.md`
- **Storage**: All ADRs are stored in the `/adrs` directory with descriptive filenames
- **Content**: ADRs capture context, decisions, consequences, and alternatives considered
- **Versioning**: ADRs are immutable; superseding decisions create new ADRs

### üéØ Current ADRs
Our existing ADRs cover critical architectural decisions including:
- Database technology selection and rationale
- Frontend framework and version choices
- Authentication and identity management strategy
- Multi-tenancy and organization design patterns
- User role and permission system architecture
- Service schema and data modeling decisions
