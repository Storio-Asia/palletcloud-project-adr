## Context

The PalletCloud project requires a relational database management system to handle core application data including user management, order processing, inventory tracking, and system configuration. We need to select between MySQL and PostgreSQL as our primary database solution.

Key project considerations:
- Small to medium scale project with moderate data volumes
- Development team has varying levels of database expertise
- Timeline constraints require rapid development and deployment
- Infrastructure simplicity is preferred for initial deployment

## Decision

We have decided to use MySQL as our primary database management system for the PalletCloud project.

The primary factors driving this decision are:

1. **Developer Familiarity**: The development team has more collective experience with MySQL, reducing the learning curve and potential for implementation errors
2. **Project Scale**: The current project scope and expected data volumes do not require the advanced features that PostgreSQL offers
3. **Implementation Speed**: Using MySQL will accelerate our development timeline due to team familiarity and simpler setup requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development velocity due to team's existing MySQL knowledge
- Reduced risk of database-related implementation delays
- Simpler deployment and maintenance procedures
- Lower initial infrastructure complexity
- Extensive community support and documentation availability
- Good performance for our current scale requirements

### Negative
- Limited advanced data types compared to PostgreSQL (JSON, arrays, etc.)
- Fewer built-in analytical functions
- May require migration if project scales significantly beyond current projections
- Less robust handling of complex queries and concurrent operations
- Potential future limitations for advanced features like full-text search

## Alternatives Considered

### PostgreSQL
**Pros:**
- Superior handling of complex data types and operations
- Better performance for complex queries and analytics
- More robust ACID compliance
- Advanced features like window functions, CTEs, and JSON operations
- Better support for concurrent operations

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve for the current development team
- Would slow down initial development phase
- More complex setup and configuration requirements
- Potential over-engineering for current project needs

### Decision Rationale
While PostgreSQL offers more advanced features, the combination of team familiarity with MySQL, the moderate scale of our current project, and the need for rapid implementation makes MySQL the more pragmatic choice for this phase of development. We can reassess this decision if the project requirements change significantly in the future.
